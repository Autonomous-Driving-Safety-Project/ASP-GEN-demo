# ASP-GEN-demo

This repository includes some examples to help understand the ASP planning part of ACSG. Each program is a single `*.lp` file that you can run with:

```shell
clingo 1 FILENAME.lp
```

You can change the number `1` to another number to get a different number of answer sets.

To install clingo, see [https://potassco.org/clingo/](https://potassco.org/clingo/).
